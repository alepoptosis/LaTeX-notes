# LaTeX beginner notes
All the basic LaTeX how-tos in a single document. The information mainly comes from [Overleaf's Documentation](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Main_Page "Overleaf Documentation"). It's still a work in progress, so more will be added as I keep studying it!

Feel free to import the .tex file in your favourite editor and use it as a reference when writing your next LaTeX document! Made for beginners (like me), but suitable for anyone with a short memory and who can't be bothered googling every single thing. You can have a peek at the PDF here, but as of now *it is meant to be read along with the code*.

Remember that for the document to compile properly, you will need to download the entire folder and run the main file (LaTeX notes.tex) while in that folder!

Note: compiling the document on your local editor might prompt the download of a few packages, especially if you're just starting out.

To be added in no particular order (thanks, reddit!):
- ~~\input and \include commands, to import code from other .tex files;~~ Section on \input and \include added;
- ~~macros, to allow creation of custom commands and environments;~~ Chapter on macros (commands and environments) added;
- more information on writing and formatting of equations;
- ~~a version of the PDF which shows both the code and the output, for quicker reference;~~ Adding explicit code where possible;
- ~~[cleveref](https://texblog.org/2013/05/06/cleveref-a-clever-way-to-reference-in-latex/ "cleveref") for figure/table referencing instead of the built-in system;~~ Cleveref now in use;
- reference to the [booktabs](http://ctan.mirrors.hoobly.com/macros/latex/contrib/booktabs/booktabs.pdf "booktabs documentation") package for better tables.
- ~~code listing and verbatim environments;~~ Verbatim package added and utilised in the macro section;
- how to have the preamble in a separate file.
